# Follow these steps:

## 1) Clone the Repository:
  - Open Terminal on your Mac.
  - Change the directory to where you want to clone the repository (e.g., cd Desktop).
  - Use the git clone command followed by the repository URL. If you don't have the URL, go back to the GitHub page, click the green "Code" button, and copy the HTTPS link.
  - Example command: git clone https://github.com/ac-i2i-engineering/MobileDevelopment.git

## 2) Open the Project in Xcode:
  - After cloning, navigate to the project directory in the Terminal (e.g., cd MobileDevelopment/iOS/iOS Hello World).
  - Open the Xcode project by typing open MobileDevelopment.xcodeproj and hit Enter. This will launch Xcode with your project.

## 3) Explore the Project:
  - Once the project is open in Xcode, you can explore the files, run the app, and make modifications as needed.
  - You'll see the project structure on the left panel of Xcode, where you can access source files, resources, and other project configurations.

## 4) Run the Project:
  - Select a target device or simulator from the top device toolbar.
  - Press the "Run" button (play icon) in the top left corner to build and run the application.
